    Given that a smart contract "erc20.wasm" is located in the "contracts" folder
    When the wasm is loaded as from the file system
    And the wasm has been successfully deployed
    Then the account named keys contain the "erc20" name
    And the contract data "name" is a "String" with a value of "Acme Token" and bytes of "0a00000041636d6520546f6b656e"
    And the contract data "symbol" is a "String" with a value of "ACME" and bytes of "0400000041434d45"
    And the contract data "decimals" is a "U8" with a value of "11" and bytes of "0b"
    And the contract data "total_supply" is a "U256" with a value of "500000000000" and bytes of "050088526a74"
 #   And the contract dictionary item "balances" is a "U256" with a value of "500000000000" and bytes of "050088526a74"
    When the contract entry point is invoked with a transfer amount of "2500000000"
    Then the contract invocation deploy is successful
